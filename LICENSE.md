6	Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
7	document, but changing it is not allowed.
8	
9	This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and
10	conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the
11	additional permissions listed below.
12	
13	#### 0. Additional Definitions.
14	
15	As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
16	Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
17	License.
18	
19	"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an
20	Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
21	
22	An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
23	Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
24	of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface
25	provided by the Library.
26	
27	A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with
28	the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work
29	was made is also called the "Linked Version".
30	
31	The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding
32	Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the
33	Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and
34	not on the Linked Version.
35	
36	The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code
37	and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs
38	needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the
39	System Libraries of the Combined Work.
40	
41	#### 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
42	
43	You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
44	being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
45	
46	#### 2. Conveying Modified Versions.
47	
48	If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
49	refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
50	facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then
51	you may convey a copy of the modified version:
52	
53	**a)** under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure
54	  that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
55	  facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
56	  meaningful, or
57	
58	**b)** under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this
59	  License applicable to that copy.
60	
61	#### 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
62	
63	The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
64	file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of
65	your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
66	numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
67	inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of
68	the following:
69	
70	**a)** Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library
71	  is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
72	
73	**b)** Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
74	  document.
75	
76	#### 4. Combined Works.
77	
78	You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together,
79	effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library
80	contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such
81	modifications, if you also do each of the following:
82	
83	**a)** Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the
84	  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
85	  License.
86	
87	**b)** Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
88	  document.
89	
90	**c)** For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
91	  include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a
92	  reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license
93	  document.
94	
95	**d)** Do one of the following:
96	
97	**0)** Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
98	  and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms
99	  that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified
100	  version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
101	  manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding
102	  Source.
103	
104	**1)** Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A
105	  suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library
106	  already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly
107	  with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the
108	  Linked Version.
109	
110	* * *
111	
112	**e)** Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
113	required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to
114	the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified
115	version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application
116	with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the
117	Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and
118	Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the
119	Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for
120	conveying Corresponding Source.)
121	
122	#### 5. Combined Libraries.
123	
124	You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
125	side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
126	Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
127	library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
128	
129	**a)** Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
130	  Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the
131	  terms of this License.
132	
133	**b)** Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work
134	  based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined
135	  form of the same work.
136	
137	#### 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
138	
139	The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
140	Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
141	similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
142	new problems or concerns.
143	
144	Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
145	received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General
146	Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
147	following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any
148	later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
149	received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public
150	License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
151	ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
152	
153	If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
154	future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
155	proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization
156	for you to choose that version for the Library.
