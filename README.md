# HandySearch [![](https://travis-ci.org/yxwangcs/handysearch.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/yxwangcs/handysearch)

A Mini Search Engine Based On QT , Created For My Data Structure Course Design Project.

Using QMake + QT Designer.

Tested on `QT 5.2 - 5.11 on linux`, `QT 5.5 5.11 on MacOS`. 

## Features
* Beautiful GUI design. (Thanks to QT)
* Load directly from HTML files and automatically analyzes them. (in multi-thread)
* Multi-Thread optimizations make it load faster and process better.
* Briefs are shown.
* Hightlights the key-words.
* Auto-completer supported.

## For Developers
* UI and process threads are completely separeted in order not to cause mess.
* Most of the UI Design copies from Baidu and Google.(lol)
* Release version provides around 400 sample webpages randomly collected by a python script. I collected 7000 webpages in total and filtered them down to around 4000.
